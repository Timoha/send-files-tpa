TODO:

- tests
- verification if Google Drive is full

- use passport.js for general authorization
- check for session id?

- allow site owner to choose upload file size limit (an essay grader doesn't need 1 GB file limits)
- implement popup-modal directive
- implement google login iframe in modal
- add javascript to detect whether the site owner has connected an account to the send-files widget and display acc-content accordingly

NOTES:

google needs offline mode to use refresh tokens
dropbox's access token is persistent, no need for refresh token or expiration
box has a refresh token by default, looks just like google's


clean up temporary files every 24 hour regradles whether they are marked for deletion or not.
adv:
    no need for ready to delete column
dis:
    what if they are not uploaded within 24 hours?
        should be error then.
